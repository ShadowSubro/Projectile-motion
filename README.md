# Projectile Motion Simulator

Welcome to the **Projectile Motion Simulator**! This repository provides a simple yet powerful tool to simulate and visualize the motion of projectiles under various conditions. It's designed to help students, educators, and enthusiasts understand the physics of projectile motion through interactive simulations and easy-to-read code.

## Features

- 🧮 **Accurate Physics Simulation:** Models projectile motion with customizable parameters (initial velocity, angle, gravity, etc.).
- 📊 **Graphical Visualization:** Plots trajectories in real-time for better understanding.
- 🛠️ **User Input:** Easily adjust variables to see how they affect the path.
- 💡 **Educational:** Clean code and comments for learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (see [Installation](#installation))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShadowSubro/Projectile-motion.git
   cd Projectile-motion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If there is no `requirements.txt`, typical dependencies include `matplotlib` and `numpy`)*

### Usage

Run the main script to start the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted (or can edit the script) to enter:
- Initial velocity
- Launch angle
- Height
- Gravity

The program will then calculate and display the projectile's trajectory.

## Example
